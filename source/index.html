        What I can do for you
    </h2>
    <ul class="block-list">
        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-files-o palette-rose"></i>
                You want to build a modern (web) application
            </h3>
            <p>
                I know my way around modern PHP and can help you with building a web application, API,
                micro service or middleware with proper documentation and tests.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-battery-half palette-orange"></i>
                You own a legacy application which needs improvement
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many software projects turn into legacy projects over time.
                Reasons being the use of obsolete technologies, lack of tests, tight coupling and high complexity.
                When your application is still valuable to your company I can modernize your codebase,
                set up a testing strategy and write documentation.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-server palette-petrol"></i>
                You would like to be able to deploy your application at any given time but your current setup doesn't
                let you do that
            </h3>
            <p>
                The era of waiting hours, days or even months before deploying an update of your application
                to production are over. Current technology and practices let us deploy fast and often.
                I can help you with continuous integration and deployment.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-ship palette-grey"></i>
                You often experience that your application which worked perfectly on development doesn't work in
                production.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many issues with applications are caused by differences in the dev/test/production pipeline.
                This can be prevented by making sure the stack of operating system + web server + runtime + the
                application itself is consistent in every stage. I can help you set Linux containers (Docker),
                which solves this issue entirely.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-users palette-salmon"></i>
                You want your (junior) developers to be trained
            </h3>
            <p>
                Junior developers are often very eager to learn. I can teach them modern PHP practices,
                test-driven development and coach them in their webdevelopment careers.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">

            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-check palette-dark-mint"></i>
                You own an application and you want to know how well it's built
            </h3>

            <p>
                If you have an application and you're unsure about its quality I can do an audit and give you an
                overview of possible (security)issues, point to areas that need your attention and suggest improvements.
