# Vlog

This is the story of My Land Rover discovert and how I converted it. I'm Lucas, professional software engineer by and I hobby mechanic. In this vlog I'll tell about my adventures in building and driving it. By now I feel bad that I didn't start vlogging about this project years ago like one of my examples Jehu Garcia, but at least I still have the pictures. Hopefully the project raises some questions so I can do a Q&A video. For now I will vlog the entire 9 years I've owned the car in one pilot episode

2008
* Why I bought this vehicle?
Well, I was rebuilding my house for over 2 years {insert flash: reconstuction pictures}. My parents – who always help me! - helped me out getting all kinds of building materials { flash picutres } and also helped me transporting all kinds of trash to the recyling station {insert pictures}

However, sometimes I needed something when my parents weren't there and so I had to go by bike. I can tell you that's really hard {flash pictures} , sometimes I had to carry loads of more than 100 kg (picture}. At at given moment my boss bought a brand new Land Rover Discovery (flash picture + options ALLTHETHINGS + 80K+}. Then I made a decision I thougt: “this is enough, I'm not doing this anymore, I need to get myself a ride too!” So I also bought a Land Rover Discovery. It was also a diesel, it was also green (the color at least), 4x4, heavy etc. The -only- difference was that that was over 10 years old, dented, rusty,  (Picutre of  first ride|. But hey, I suddenly had my frst car, and it was a still a pretty cool car to drive.

So now I had the car I could do my own hauling {insert hauling pictures}, I made new friends I could go to meetings {insert prikkersdag, andere rittten}l could drive up to the North Cape {insert pictures}. I could even drive to the Sahara {insert pictures, more on that later} And off couse it was an old car – English {insert funny English pictures, so it needed lot's of maintanance.  I noticed repairs at the garagage we're hugely expensive {insert pictures of bills } so I bough a lot of tools. {insert pictures of tools }

2009

After a while I found out it needed more than just maintainence, new parts and fluids. It needed welding {insert rusty picture} My dad – who knows me very well – said something like “Son welding is hard, try do not to do everything yourself {do all the things }. Why not lot let a professional do it?” So I decided to take it to a professional. After some research I though I had found a -'professional'-. Boy was I wrong... I hadso  much debate with these guys and still ended up having to pay 3000 euro's { insert WTF?, pictures of money } But at least it was fixed now right, right? No… it wasn't , when I had the Vehicle checked a few days later it (which you have  to do every year in the Netherlands) it failed...on rusty spots which needed welding {insert picture }. So the garage fixed the rusted spot and made sure it was ok again

That was the time I made my second decision, from now on I will DIY everything I can, including welding. So I did a welding course {insert picture of certificate}. And I started welding on the car, sometimes at my parents place (insert pictures}, sometimes on the street at home {insert picture}. The welding light attracted many people walking by, mostly friendly neighors asking what I was up to {insert picture NICE } but also a guy (apparently a welder himself) who came up to me and said: 'you know what we call this at my work?, We call this SHIT” {insert picture, yeah, thanks buddy…}. I chose to ignore him but folks, if you're watching this: please never do this, if someone is trying to learn something wether professionally or just as an amateur. Wether it's welding, programming (I'm a programmer), cooking or whatever. Help them out, give them advice, {insert picture} ask a question.{ insert picture } Or, if you really don't care/think it's shit STFU {insert picture}.

At that time I started thinking about how awesome it would be to convert the Discovery to a (hybrid) electric system. My plan was to attach a big generator { insert picture } to the engine {insert picture}, add some batteries {insert picture} and then replace the entire heavy, maintainence requiring driveline { insert picture} with just 4 wheels with built in hub motors which then seemed to be the furure { insert pictures }. However I did lot's of research and had discussions { insert pictures } and soon learned the time wasn't yet right for this both because of the costs and the availability of parts. So this plan was skipped. {insert meme skipped }

2010

Anyway as I continued welding the car  I realized it should be done properly, and that's something you can only do when the car is dismantled. Why: because it's hard to reach certain spots for welding, because if you CAN weld on one side, you can't always reach the other side to fix the burnt pain causing it to rust again but most important because you set the thing on fire {insert been there done that picture } SO another decision (insert pricture } :rip this thing apart and start fixing it properly….And have it treated afterwards. {insert pictures of treating }

Also, while people started laughing at me when I said  the car really wasn't that big it actually wasn't. It was maybe little wider than average cars althoug not that much. It was certainly higher, but not vey long. Actually it had the same wheelbase as my parents Renault Megane. And if I were to place passenger seats in it not many cargo space would be left. At least not enough for traveeling or hauling. So the plan was to make it bigger somehow, maybe just stretch it?! {insert picture stetch meme} But first: on the road again.

So another trip. This time we would leave our continent for the first time, we would be heading for Morocco {insert picture} – or even cooler we're going to Africa! {insert picture of Africa}
So I in preparation I had bought new tires, Hi-Jack lift {inset pictures, a snorkel, extra jerry cans, double battery system, working light etc. we drove up to Spain, took the boat to Tanger and drove around. It was an AMAZING trip{insert picture and  music Don't go loose it baby }

We returned home in octobober and I had
