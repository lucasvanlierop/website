title: Combining unit and system test coverage

If you do things by the book you - should - have 100% code coverage. 
In practice not many project have this.
But some projects have a combination of unit and system tests.
Wouldn't it be nice if the coverage of both could be combined?
And yes both kind of tests might not test code the same way but at least all lines are covered
