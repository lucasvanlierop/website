## Inspirators:

- [Jehu Garcia](https://twitter.com/jag35), because of all the 'driving in sunny California' feelgood moments he gave me while watching his 
    [Volkswagen T1 'Samba' conversion series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UeVsHmKAFA&list=PL2l32K1w0jp-m04Jl-3PHmtapevOuCeIp). 
- [Robert Llewellyn](https://twitter.com/bobbyllew), because of his 
    [vision on the future of electric cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6q7_xN0ilag)
- [Lars Rengersen](https://twitter.com/oudevolvo), because of doing 
    [an actual EV conversion in the Netherlands compliant with Dutch law](https://www.oudevolvo.nl/ev-combi/)
