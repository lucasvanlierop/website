Todo

So you hwant to 
build images with docker, 
build js/css/images/fonts with grunt/gulp/webpack/new kid on  the block
run unit tests
run code inspections
run system/end to end tests
push images
deploy
start images with Docker compose
run all of this in a CI

 To orchestrate this Make since 1976
