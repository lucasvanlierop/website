        Hi, I'm Lucas, freelance software engineer. My goal is to build well designed, well tested and properly
        documented applications that meet your business case.
    </p>

    <p>
        Besides being engineer I'm also organizer of <a href="http://domcode.org/">DomCode</a>, a non-profit foundation with 1200+
        members that organizes events like the annual <a href="http://conference.domcode.org">DomCode conference</a> and
        monthly
        <a href="http://meetup.com/domcode">DomCode meetups</a> where (inter) national speakers share their knowledge on
        software development.
    </p>

    <p>
        I previously worked at Rhinocreations.nl (now Ganda.com), i-Aspect.com and Ibuildings.nl.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like to see my <a href="work/">work?</a>
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I valude knowledge sharing a lot I became an occasional <a href="public-appearances/">speaker</a> myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love to work with other freelancers and companies. Interested?
    </p>
