    <p>
        I'm Lucas, a freelance software engineer, working professionaly since 2004.
        My goal is to build well designed, well tested and properly documented applications that exceed your expectations.
    </p>

    <p>
        I work mostly in PHP and Javascript, but I'm learning other languages as well. For more info check my <a href="expertise/">expertise</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Besides being engineer I'm also organizer of <a href="http://domcode.org/">DomCode</a>, a non-profit foundation with 1200+
        members that organizes events like the annual <a href="http://conference.domcode.org">DomCode conference</a> and
        monthly DomCode meetups where (inter)national speakers share their knowledge on
        software development.
        Since I value knowledge sharing a lot I became an occasional <a href="public-appearances/">speaker</a> myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        I love to work with other freelancers or companies. Contact me if you are interested.
