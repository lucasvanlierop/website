        Let me help you:

            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-files-o palette-rose"></i>
                You want to build a modern (web) application
            </h3>
            <p>
                I know my way around in modern PHP and can help you with building a web application, API,
                microservice,
                middleware.
                With proper documentation and tests.

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-battery-half palette-orange"></i>
                You own a legacy application which needs improvement
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many software projects turn into legacy projects over time.
                Reasons being the use of older, maybe even obsolete technologies. Lack of tests, close coupling.
                When the application is still (very) valuable to your company I can help to modernize the
                application,
                set up a testing strategy and write documentation.
            </p>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-server palette-petrol"></i>
                You would like to be able to deploy any time of the day but your current setup doesn't let you
                do that
            </h3>
            <p>
                The era of waiting hours, days or even months before deploying a new version of an application
                to
                production are over.
                Current technology always us to deploy fast and often.
                I can help preparing your application, setting up a CI server, setting up automatic deployment.
            </p>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-ship palette-grey"></i>
                You want to migrate your application(s) to a containerized platform
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many issues with applications are caused by differences in the dev/test/production pipeline.
                This can be prevented by making sure the stack of operating system + web server + runtime + the
                application itself is consistent in every stage.
                Even more than with virtual machines this can be achieved by using Linux containers.

                You want your (junior) developers to be trained in services or coached in their working
                process
            </h3>
            <p>
                Junior developers are often very eager to learn and grasp knowledge.
                I can help them to make the right choices.
            </p>

                You own an application and you want to know how well it's built
            </h3>

            <p>
                If your owner of an application and you're not sure about it's state I can do a review/audit and
                come up
                with
                warn about areas that need attention, suggest improvments.
