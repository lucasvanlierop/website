    <h2>
        Let me help you:
    </h2>
    <ul class="block-list">
        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-files-o palette-rose"></i>
                You want to build a modern (web) application
            </h3>
            <p>
                I know my way around in modern PHP and can help you with building a web application, API,
                micro service or middleware with proper documentation and tests.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-battery-half palette-orange"></i>
                You own a legacy application which needs improvement
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many software projects turn into legacy projects over time.
                Reasons being the use of obsolete technologies, lack of tests, tight coupling, high complexity.
                When the application is still (very) valuable to your company I can help to modernize the application,
                set up a testing strategy, write documentation etc.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-server palette-petrol"></i>
                You would like to be able to deploy your application at any given time but your current setup doesn't
                let you do that
            </h3>
            <p>
                The era of waiting hours, days or even months before deploying a new version of an application
                to production are over. Current technology always us to deploy fast and often.
                I can help to set up continuous integration and deployment.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-ship palette-grey"></i>
                You often experience that your application that worked perfectly on development doesn't work in
                production.
            </h3>
            <p>
                Many issues with applications are caused by differences in the dev/test/production pipeline.
                This can be prevented by making sure the stack of operating system + web server + runtime + the
                application itself is consistent in every stage.
                Even more than with virtual machines this can be achieved by using Linux containers (Docker).
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">
            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-users palette-salmon"></i>
                You want your (junior) developers to be trained
            </h3>
            <p>
                Junior developers are often very eager to learn and grasp knowledge.
                I can help them learning about development, testing and coach them in their working process.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="block">

            <h3>
                <i class="fa fa-check palette-dark-mint"></i>
                You own an application and you want to know how well it's built
            </h3>

            <p>
                If own an application and you're unsure about it's quality I can do a audit and make a report about
                possible issues, point to areas that need attention and suggest improvements.
